# NYCAirbnbRegression
### Project Overview:
Cost is a big problem in many parts of the world, especially in Bay Area. As someone who first lived in New York city then San Francisco, the two most expensive cities in the U.S., I am always interested in understanding the attributes of living cost. Kaggle provides a great dataset of New York city Airbnb prices that allows me to explore what factors play a role in the cost of Airbnb.

This dataset includes customers’ reviews, neighborhood, borough, latitude and longitude, room type, and other information of each Airbnb unit instance. In this project, I will explore the following questions.

- How does the Airbnb price vary based on its location?
- Do different room types lead to different prices?
- What is the overall sentiment of the customers’ reviews?
- Can we predict Airbnb prices with a model?
